\begin{tcbProblem}[label={problem:0017:question:Eng}]
	If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are \( 3 \mathplus 3 \mathplus 5 \mathplus 4 \mathplus 4 \equal 19 \) letters used in total.

	If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

	{\small
		\emph{NOTE:}
		Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters.
		The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
