\begin{tcbProblem}[label={problem:0067:question:Eng}]
	By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

	That is, \( 3 \mathplus 7 \mathplus 4 \mathplus 9 \equal 23 \).
	
	Find the maximum total from top to bottom in \href{https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p067_triangle.txt}{triangle.txt} (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

	\textbf{NOTE}:
	This is a much more difficult version of \hyperref[prob:0018]{Problem 18}.
	It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are \( { 2 }^{ 99 } \) altogether!
	If you could check one trillion (\( { 10 }^{ 12 } \)) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all.
	There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
