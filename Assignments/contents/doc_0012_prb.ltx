\begin{tcbProblem}[label={problem:0012:question:Eng}]
	The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
	So the 7th triangle number would be \( 1 \mathplus 2 \mathplus 3 \mathplus 4 \mathplus 5 \mathplus 6 \mathplus 7 \equal 28 \).
	The first ten terms would be:
	\begin{center}
		\( 1 \mathcomma 3 \mathcomma 6 \mathcomma 10 \mathcomma 15 \mathcomma 21 \mathcomma 28 \mathcomma 36 \mathcomma 45 \mathcomma 55 \mathcomma \unicodecdots \)
	\end{center}

	Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
	\begin{center}
		\vskip\baselineskip%
		\begin{tabular}{r@{\ :\ }l}
			1  & {\ttfamily 1 }\\%
			3  & {\ttfamily 1,\,3 }\\%
			6  & {\ttfamily 1,\,2,\,3,\,6 }\\%
			10 & {\ttfamily 1,\,2,\,5,\,10 }\\%
			15 & {\ttfamily 1,\,3,\,5,\,15 }\\%
			21 & {\ttfamily 1,\,3,\,7,\,21 }\\%
			28 & {\ttfamily 1,\,2,\,4,\,7,\,14,\,28 }\\%
		\end{tabular}
		\vskip\baselineskip%
	\end{center}
	We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

	What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
