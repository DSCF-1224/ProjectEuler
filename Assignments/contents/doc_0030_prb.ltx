\begin{tcbProblem}[label={problem:0030:question:Eng}]
	Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
	\begin{align*}
		1634 &\equal {1}^{4} \mathplus {6}^{4} \mathplus {3}^{4} \mathplus {4}^{4} \\%
		8208 &\equal {8}^{4} \mathplus {2}^{4} \mathplus {0}^{4} \mathplus {8}^{4} \\%
		9474 &\equal {9}^{4} \mathplus {4}^{4} \mathplus {7}^{4} \mathplus {4}^{4}
	\end{align*}
	As \( 1 \equal {1}^{4} \) is not a sum it is not included.

	The sum of these numbers is \( 1634 \mathplus 8208 \mathplus 9474 \equal 19316 \).

	Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
