	\( 145 \) is a curious number, as \( 1\mathexclam \mathplus 4\mathexclam \mathplus 5\mathexclam \equal 1 \mathplus 24 \mathplus 120 \equal 145 \).

	Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

	Note: as \( 1\mathexclam \equal 1 \) and \( 2\mathexclam \equal 2 \) are not sums they are not included.
