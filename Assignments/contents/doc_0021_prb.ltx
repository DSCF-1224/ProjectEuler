\begin{tcbProblem}[label={problem:0021:question:Eng}]
	Let \( d \lparen n \rparen \) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of \( n \) (numbers less than \( n \) which divide evenly into \( n \)).

	If \( d \lparen a \rparen \equal b \) and \( d \lparen b \rparen \equal a \),
	where \( a \neq b \),
	then \( a \) and \( b \) are an amicable pair and each of \( a \) and \( b \) are called amicable numbers.

	For example,
	the proper divisors of \( 220 \) are \( 1 \mathcomma 2 \mathcomma 4 \mathcomma 5 \mathcomma 10 \mathcomma 11 \mathcomma 20 \mathcomma 22 \mathcomma 44 \mathcomma 55 \) and \( 110 \); therefore \( d \lparen 220 \rparen \equal 284 \).
	The proper divisors of \( 284 \) are \( 1 \mathcomma 2 \mathcomma 4 \mathcomma 71 \) and \( 142 \); so \( d \lparen 284 \rparen \equal 220 \).

	Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under \( 10000 \).
