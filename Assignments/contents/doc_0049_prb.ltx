\begin{tcbProblem}[label={problem:0049:question:Eng}]
	The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways:
	\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman{*})}]
		\item each of the three terms are prime, and,
		\item each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.
	\end{enumerate*}
	There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.

	What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?
