\begin{tcbProblem}[label={problem:0042:question:Eng}]
	The \( n \) th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, \( t_n \equal (1/2)n(n+1) \);
	so the first ten triangle numbers are:
	\begin{equation*}
		1 \mathcomma 3 \mathcomma 6 \mathcomma 10 \mathcomma 15 \mathcomma 21 \mathcomma 28 \mathcomma 36 \mathcomma 45 \mathcomma 55 \mathcomma \unicodecdots
	\end{equation*}
	By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is \( 19 \mathplus 11 \mathplus 25 \equal 55 \equal {t}_{10} \).
	If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

	Using \href{https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p042_words.txt}{words.txt} (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
