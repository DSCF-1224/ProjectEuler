\begin{tcbProblem}[label={problem:0046:question:Eng}]
	It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
	\begin{align*}
		9  \equal  7 \mathplus 2 \times {1}^{2} \\%
		15 \equal  7 \mathplus 2 \times {2}^{2} \\%
		21 \equal  3 \mathplus 2 \times {3}^{2} \\%
		25 \equal  7 \mathplus 2 \times {3}^{2} \\%
		27 \equal 19 \mathplus 2 \times {2}^{2} \\%
		33 \equal 31 \mathplus 2 \times {1}^{2}
	\end{align*}
	It turns out that the conjecture was false.

	What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
