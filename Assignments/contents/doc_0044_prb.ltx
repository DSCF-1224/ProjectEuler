\begin{tcbProblem}[label={problem:0044:question:Eng}]
	Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, \( {P}_{n} \equal n \lparen 3n \minus 1 \rparen \fracslash \) 2.
	The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
	\begin{equation*}
		1   \mathcomma
		5   \mathcomma
		12  \mathcomma
		22  \mathcomma
		35  \mathcomma
		51  \mathcomma
		70  \mathcomma
		92  \mathcomma
		117 \mathcomma
		145 \mathcomma \unicodecdots
	\end{equation*}
	It can be seen that \( {P}_{4} \mathplus {P}_{7} \equal 22 \mathplus 70 \equal 92 \equal {P}_{8} \).
	However, their difference, \( 70 \minus 22 \equal 48 \), is not pentagonal.

	Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, \( P_j \) and \( P_k \), for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and \( D \equal \vert {P}_{k} \minus {P}_{j} \vert \) is minimised; what is the value of \( D \) ?
