\begin{tcbProblem}[label={problem:0070:question:Eng}]
	Euler's Totient function, \( \varphi \lparen n \rparen \) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to \( n \) which are relatively prime to \( n \).
	For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, \( \varphi \lparen 9 \rparen \equal 6 \).
	The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so \( \varphi \lparen 1 \rparen \equal 1 \).

	Interestingly, \( \varphi \lparen 87109 \rparen \equal 79180 \), and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.

	Find the value of \( n \), \( 1 \less n \less 107 \), for which \( \varphi \lparen n \rparen \) is a permutation of \( n \) and the ratio \( n \fracslash \varphi \lparen n \rparen \) produces a minimum.
