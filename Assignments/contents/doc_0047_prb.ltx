\begin{tcbProblem}[label={problem:0047:question:Eng}]
	The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:
	\begin{align*}
		14 &\equal 2 \times 7 \\%
		15 &\equal 3 \times 5 %
	\end{align*}
	The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:
	\begin{align*}
		644 &\equal {2}^{2} \times 7 \times 23 \\%
		645 &\equal 3 \times 5 \times 43 \\%
		646 &\equal 2 \times 17 \times 19 %
	\end{align*}
	Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?
